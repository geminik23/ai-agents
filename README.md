# ai-agents

This repository is a Rust library designed for building and managing generative AI agents, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. The aim of this project is to provides a robust and scalable framework that is adaptable to a wide range of scenarios. (`ai-agents` is at **a very early stage** of development.)

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Enhances the creation of complex AI behaviors by chaining together smaller, interoperable components. This is reusability and flexibility across different projects.
- **Agent and Module Traits**: a flexible interface for building custom agents and modules, allowing for the execution of sophisticated AI tasks with ease.
- **Asynchronous Support**

## Crates

- `ai-agent-macro`
- `sllm-rs`: A crate dedicated to interfacing with Large Language Models (LLMs), including utilities for sending requests and processing responses.


## Examples

The examples provided are simulations of limited situations.

- **Find Treasure**

- **Ecommerce Chat Assistant**
